Implementing a star or snowflake schema is one way to optimize querying since the data will be distributed to different tables instead of having all of it be in one big table. This way, we can prevent duplication of data once we implement another layer to our data which would be the date. We can have one table contain the columns date, fk_item (foreign key to item id), and price. We can also add the original price and discount to this table. With this kind of implementation, you only need to add data to one or two tables if you want to add the new prices for the current date and you would only add data to the other tables if there is a new item listing on the Goodest page. Once we finish designing the tables, we can use an index on data which would be frequently accessed to further speed up querying.
